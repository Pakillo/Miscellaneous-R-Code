# A simple demonstration of tobit regression via maximum likelihood. The issue
# is one where data is censored such that while we observe the value, it is not
# the true value, which would extend beyond the range of the observed data. This
# is very commonly seen in cases where the dependent variable has been given
# some arbitrary cutoff at the lower or upper end of the range, often resulting
# in floor or ceiling effects respectively. The conceptual idea is that we are
# interested in modeling the underlying latent variable that would not have such
# restriction if it was actually observed.


tobit <- function(par, X, y, ul=-Inf, ll=Inf) {
  
  # this function only takes a lower OR upper limit
  
  # parameters
  sigma = exp(par[length(par)]) 
  beta = par[-length(par)]
  
  # create indicator depending on chosen limit
  if (!is.infinite(ll)) {
    limit = ll
    indicator = y > ll  
  } else {
    limit = ul
    indicator = y < ul
  }
  
  # linear predictor
  lp = X %*% beta
  
  # log likelihood
  ll = sum(indicator * log((1/sigma)*dnorm((y-lp)/sigma)) ) + 
    sum((1-indicator) * log(pnorm((lp-limit)/sigma, lower=is.infinite(ll))))

# AER is actually just using survreg from the survival package. Survival models
# are usually for modeling time to some event, e.g. death in medical studies,
# and the censoring comes from the fact that the observed event does not occur
# for some people. Like our tobit function, an indicator is needed to denote who
# is or isn't censored. In survival models, the indicator is for the event
# itself, and means they are NOT censored.  So we'll reverse the indicator used
# in the tobit function for survreg.
