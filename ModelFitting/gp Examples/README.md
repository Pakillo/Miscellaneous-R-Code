Since I first did the code for these models, the Stan group has done some notable improvement in this area, both in terms of the language itself, the example chapter for Gaussian processes, and even implementing a specific function for the squared exponential kernel.  While the offerings here may still be of use, they may also be dated, so check the recent Stan manual before getting too carried away.
